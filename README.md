### Notes about GO

- How do we run code in GO ?

  By using ``` go run ``` command.
  
  <i>eg:<i> 
  ``` go run main.go ``` will return <i>Hi there!<i>

  Here's a list of go cli useful commands:

    - ``` go build ```   -> Compiles go code files
    - ``` go run ```     -> Compiles and executes go files.
    - ``` go fmt ```     -> Formats all the code in each go file.
    - ``` go install ``` -> Compiles and install a package.
    - ``` go get ```     -> Downloads the source code of a package.
    - ``` go test ```    -> Runs tests associated with a go project.

- What does <b>import "fmt"<b> means ?

- Why do we need a <b>func main()<b> ?

- How is <b>main.go<b> organized ?
